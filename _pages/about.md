I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. Fadil Santosa. Prior to joining Johns Hopkins, I completed my undergraduate studies in the School of Mathematics at Renmin University of China. My current research interests include homogenization problems for PDEs, inverse problems for PDEs, and experimental design.
